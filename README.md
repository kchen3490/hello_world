# hello_world
First repository created at NASA internship Git/Python course

What the course asks us to write verbatim:

"This is my first attempt to create a Git repository on GitHub.
The goal here is to learn how to create and maintain a repository.
I am interested in (among other things):
- Creating a branch
- Working on the branch and committing my changes.
- Merging the branch to main
